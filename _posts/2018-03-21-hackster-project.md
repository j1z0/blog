# Turn Anything into a Smart Home Device

For the competition we build a servo attached to an arduino board that is connected to the internet and Alexa.

Then we 3D printed attachments that connect to the servo head and attach to things around your house.  For example there is one attachment that connects to the wand on standard blinds and opens and closes the blinds.

We also built an attachment that connects to a pet feeder.

We only finished two attachments for the competition, but we plan on creating attachments for light switches, for a hose to water plants, a pocker attacment / button pusher and several others. 


More info about the project can be found on the [project page on hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/wise-chameleon/wise-chameleon-turn-anything-into-a-smart-device-086231?ref=challenge&ref_id=105&offset=0)

The prizes we won are focused on helping us run a Kickstarter project for this thing (which we are currently calling Moto).  So check back here often for more information about the kickstarter.

Also here is the video explaining what we build and what it does:
